###### Novelty Project Because I Watched Too Many Mission Impossibles

## Stages
#### Stage 1 
- Disable comms (USB, ssh, eth, etc)

#### Stage 2 (Hardware)
- Ignite SD card
- Short-circuit the board 

#### Stage 3 (Software)
- If still alive, overwrite SD card
- Overclock and overheat CPU


## Materials Required
- Raspberry Pi
- Jumper cables
- Nichrome wire
- Two MOSFET transistors or relay switches
- Optionally a cotton ball
